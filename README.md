# Calculator
The app is a basic calculator with basic operations like +, -, *, /, √ and ±. In theory it has unlimited decimal precision but square root is limited by double.

## About project

This simple calculator is my first app written with Flutter. The code is messier than I would like to, but deadline and lack of time made it that way.
